import FuturesSync

/// A protocol that defines objects that execute futures.
///
/// Executors provide the context in which futures execute. This context may
/// be the current or a background thread, a Dispatch queue, a run loop, etc.
/// Executors typically enqueue submitted futures in a "ready to run" queue
/// and immediately return to the caller. This queue is later on consumed by
/// the executor in its execution context, driving futures to completion by
/// polling them. The polling algorithm is roughly:
///
///     var context = self.makeContext()
///     while var future = self.readyToRunQueue.pop() {
///         if future.poll(&context).isReady {
///             self.drop(future)
///         } else {
///             self.pendingFutures.push(future)
///         }
///     }
///
/// Futures that are ready to run are polled by the executor. If the future
/// returns that it completed (see `Poll`), it is let go by the executor,
/// which causes the future and associated resources to be released. Otherwise,
/// it is added into a "pending futures" registry. Before returning, the
/// future registers the context's waker (see `Context` and `WakerProtocol`)
/// to receive a notification when the external event the future is waiting on
/// fires. As a result of the notification, the future is added back into the
/// "ready to run" queue and the process repeats until the future signifies
/// completion.
///
/// Futures are submitted for execution via the `trySubmit(_:)` method of an
/// executor. Executors guarantee that submitted futures will be executed
/// asynchronously. In other words, `trySubmit(_:)` merely schedules the
/// future to be executed at some point in the future and returns to the caller
/// immediately. This is an important invariant that custom implementations
/// must also maintain, since it removes all concerns about reentrancy.
///
/// Executors may deny to receive the future, in which case `trySubmit(_:)`
/// returns an appropriate error of type `Failure`. This can be the case when
/// the executor is shutting down or is at capacity and needs to provide
/// backpressure. Executors that never fail, declare their `Failure` type as
/// `Never`.
///
/// This protocol makes no guarantees on the safety of concurrent calls to
/// `trySubmit(_:)`. Each executor implementation is free to declare support
/// for concurrent submissions, documenting the fact accordingly. This is not
/// a problem in practice since you typically use concrete executor types
/// so you always know the specifics. All built-in executors support
/// concurrent submissions.
