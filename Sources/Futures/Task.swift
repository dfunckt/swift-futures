/// In Futures, task is both a high-level concept and a type. As a concept, it

/// As a type, it is a handle to the conceptual task, which can be used to
/// extract the result of the computation or cancel it altogether.
///
/// Tasks are futures themselves and can be seamlessly combined with other tasks
/// or futures.
///
/// `Task` guarantees that:
///
/// - the wrapped future is cancelled if the task is dropped.
/// - the wrapped future is destroyed on the executor's context it was
///   submitted on.
/// - the executor is kept alive for as long as the task itself is kept alive.
///
/// To create a task, use the `ExecutorProtocol.trySpawn(_:)` method.
///
/// To cancel the task, call `cancel()` on the instance. Cancellation also
/// happens automatically when all references to the task are dropped.

// MARK: - Task Private -

/// Notes about the implementation:
///
/// We synchronize between (at most) three threads:
///
/// - the *remote future* thread, that's polling the wrapped future to
///   store its output.
/// - the *task handle* thread, that's polling to read the output.
/// - the *canceller* thread, that signals that the task must be cancelled.
///
/// There are three resources these threads compete for:
///
/// - the future's output: set by the remote future; read by the task handle.
/// - the task handle's waker: set by the task handle; read by both the
///   remote future and the canceller.
/// - the remote future's waker: set by the remote future; read by both the
///   task handle and the canceller.
///
/// Resolving the future
/// ====================
///
/// The task handle synchronizes with the remote future for access to the
/// output as follows:
///
///  - the remote: stores output, sets `resolved` flag, signals handle waker
///  - the handle: registers waker, reads `resolved` flag, reads `output` if
///    flag is set
///
/// To register its waker, the task handle uses the `polling` flag as a lock.
/// For as long as that flag is set, the remote future does not touch the task
/// handle waker. To avoid losing the notification that may happen while the
/// `polling` flag is set, the task handle then checks for the presence of the
/// `resolved` flag and, if it's set, reads the `output`.
///
/// Cancellation
/// ============
///
/// At any moment, another thread may call `cancel()` to cancel the task.
/// Cancellation first toggles the `cancelled` flag, and then goes on to
/// signal the remote future and task handle wakers. Cancellation has the
/// highest priority of all possible states, so the moment the remote
/// future and the task handle observe the fact, they bail out.
///
/// Synchronizing access of the canceller to the remote future waker is
/// straightforward. The remote future, similarly to the task handle, sets
/// a flag, stores its waker, unsets the flag and checks for cancellation.
/// The canceller, before accessing the waker, checks for the presence of
/// that flag and, if it's not set, signals the waker.
///
/// Synchronizing access of the canceller to the task handle waker is even
/// easier, even though the canceller competes with the remote future that
/// may be trying to signal completion to the task handle at the same time.
/// This is because the remote future will only touch the task handle waker
/// if the `polling` flag is not present when it toggles the `resolved` flag.
/// So the canceller merely has to check for the absense of *both* these
/// flags. If either flag is set, it is guaranteed that the task handle will
/// observe the cancellation either because it's currently not idle, or has
/// been signalled already by the remote future.
